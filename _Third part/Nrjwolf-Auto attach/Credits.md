A tool that automatize the process of getting the reference of a component in awake/start by marking field with an attribute. It seems to hammering just when the field is null and just OnGUI messages.

Code got from: https://github.com/Nrjwolf/unity-auto-attach-component-attributes
- Moved it my own namespace to avoid unecessary usings 
- Removed a menu to disable it (dont see a reason to disable it)
